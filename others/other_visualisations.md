# Collection of All Work

[Developing Meaningful Indicators](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/curriculum/usp-modules/developing-meaningful-indicators/) (DMI) was a module in USP taught be Dr. Charles Burke.
DMI allowed us understand, use, and visualise data in a way that prioritises creating an effect on others.
This is in-line with the [USP](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/about/overview/)'s purpose to shape independent, adaptable thinkers and doers who will make an impact in the world.

This page serves as repository of all my work created during this module. Each set of visualisation are presented in chronological order, and iterations within each set can be observed as well.
